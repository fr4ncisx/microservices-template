# Template for Microservices with Spring Cloud

## Introducing
![Microservices-template](/assets/microservices.png)

This project is a lightweight and preconfigured starter template that sets up the foundational infrastructure for building microservices using Spring Cloud. It includes essential components to enable service discovery, routing, and centralized configuration management.

## ðŸ”§ Included Components:
âœ… **Spring Boot 3.5.0** â€“ The project inherits Spring Boot 3.5.0 to all modules.

âœ… **Spring Cloud BOM** â€“ The project inherits Spring Boot and imports Spring Cloud dependencies via a managed BOM.

âœ… **Spring Cloud Config Server** â€“ Centralized externalized configuration for all services

âœ… **Eureka Server** â€“ Service registry for discovering and managing microservices dynamically

âœ… **Spring Cloud Gateway** â€“ API gateway for intelligent routing and load balancing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Doesn't include Structured Modular Design and Sample Services with their Feign Clients

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Spring-Cloud 2025.0.0 just released so now it's compatible with Spring Boot 3.5.X
> You can read the [release Notes](https://spring.io/blog/2025/05/29/spring-cloud-2025-0-0-is-abvailable)

## Configurations
It brings all configurations in config server like it shows in the diagram [Microservices-template](#Introducing) this are the steps you should follow after creating new modules

1. When you add your first microservice you should add the next dependencies ``netflix-eureka-client`` `config-client`
2. The application.yml needs to be using ``optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888`` in ``spring.config.import`` to the route of config-server and de application name should be the same as the config folder in this example we'll call the ``spring.application.name=module-service``
3. Example: ``module-service.yml`` should be located in ``[config-server].../resources/config`` with all configurations like a monolithic ``application.yml`` server port, database url, user, password, and all you need all in that ``module-service.yml`` located in ``config-server``
4. And that's it, now you should start servers in this order: 
 > ``[config-server]`` -> ``[eureka-server]`` -> ``[gateway-service]`` -> ``[all-others-msvc]``
## Purpose of this template

This template is ideal for bootstrapping new microservices projects by providing a working skeleton of the core infrastructure. Developers can plug in their business services later, allowing for rapid and scalable development aligned with modern cloud-native practices.
